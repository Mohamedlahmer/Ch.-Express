    <h1> Water resources engineering : </h1>
    <p>Water works has been a major axis of our activity for the past forty years. We are particularly interested in projects
    pertaining to water resource mobilization, waste water treatment, transfer and distribution, drinking water supply and
    waste water and storm water sanitation. We operate in urban, semi-urban and rural environments. Our team is able to meet
    the growing challenges that water works require. All these activities are under the responsibility of the EAE
    department, standing for Eau (Water) Agriculture (Agriculture) and Environnement (Environment)</p>
